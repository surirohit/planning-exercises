## Homework Assignment 4

Fork and clone this repository: https://github.com/duckietown/planning-exercises

In the `implementation.py` implement the equivalent CarDynamics according to the description of Lavalleâ€™s book (see 13.1.2.1 A simple car).

Create a class `CarDynamics` that integrates the dynamics of a car in the pattern of `DifferentialDriveDynamics`. We provided you with the classes `CarCommmands` and `CarParameters`.

`CarCommands` has two variables:

 - `linear_velocity`
 - `steering_angle`

`CarParameters` has one variable:

 - `wheel_distance`

To test your solution run `python test.py` in the repository. If your solution is correct you should see the message: `All tests passed successfully!`

To automatically test your solution commit your changes to your forked repository and note the CircleCI badge (make sure you followed instructions at the beginning of this document).

Copy the `implementation.py` file to `ethz-fall2018-subs/Homework Assignment 4/AMOD18-ETH-last_name-duckiebot_name/`. Push your solution and make a pull request.

Deadline is 23:59:59 on Tuesday 13.11.2018.
